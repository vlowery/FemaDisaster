#The p-value for this test is extremely small (<.0005). Thus, the average weight
#loss for at least one of the diet groups differs from the average weight loss of
#the others. We reject the null hypothesis that the average weight loss is the
#same for each of the types of diet.

#####X^2 Test of Independence#####

quiz.data = matrix(c(44, 21, 12, 18), nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
dimnames(quiz.data) = list(Attendance = c("Present", "Absent"),
                           Grade = c("Pass", "Fail"))

chisq.test(quiz.data) #Conducting the X^2 test of independence data on the quiz
                      #data.

#The p-value for this test is very small (0.02001). This is an indication that
#under our null hypothesis, it would be extremely unlikely to observe results
#like we have observed in our data. The null hypothesis states that the attendance
#and grade variables are independent of one another; however, the test provides
#evidence against this assertion. Therefore, we conclude in favor of the
#alternative hypothesis that the variables of attendance and grade are not
#independent of one another.

#####Chick Weight Data Set Examples#####
########################################
library(datasets) #Load the base R datasets library.

help(chickwts) #See the help documentation for the chickwts dataset to see a
               #description of the included variables.

chickwts #Visually inspect the data.

summary(chickwts) #Returns the five-number summary, along with the mean,
                  #for any continuous variables; returns the count information
                  #for any categorical variables.

sd(chickwts$weight) #Returns the standard deviation of the weight variable.

var(chickwts$weight) #Returns the variance of the weight variable.

table(chickwts) #Returns a contingency table of weight and feed.

#We are told that the true average weight of chicks should be around 280 grams;
#however, we do not believe this is the case. We want to test the notion that the
#weight of chicks should be centered at a value lower than 280 grams. The average
#chick weight of our dataset is 261.3 grams. Is this significantly different for
#us to change our belief? To decide, we use a One-Sample T-Test:

plot(density(chickwts$weight), main = "Overall Distribution of Chick Weights")
abline(v = mean(chickwts$weight), lwd = 2, lty = 2)
abline(v = 280, lwd = 2, lty = 2, col = "red")
legend("topright", c("True Mean = 261.3", "H0 Mean = 280"), lwd = 2,
       lty = 2, col = c("black", "red"))

boxplot(chickwts$weight, main = "Overall Distribution of Chick Weights")
abline(h = mean(chickwts$weight), lwd = 2, lty = 2)
abline(h = 280, lwd = 2, lty = 2, col = "red")
legend("topright", c("True Mean = 261.3", "H0 Mean = 280"), lwd = 2,
       lty = 2, col = c("black", "red"))

t.test(chickwts$weight, mu = 280, alternative = "less")

#The p-value for this test is 0.02376 which is less than our threshold of 0.05.
#Thus, we conclude in favor of the alternative hypothesis; our data supports the
#notion that the true average chick weight is actually less than 280 grams.

#The chicks were fed one of six types of feed; is there evidence that the average
#chick weights are different among the varied categories of feed? To decide, we
#conduct a One-Way ANOVA:

boxplot(chickwts$weight ~ chickwts$feed,
        col = c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "violet"),
        main = "Distribution of Chick Weights\nfor Various Feed Types")

summary(aov(chickwts$weight ~ chickwts$feed))

#The p-value for this test is <.0005. This is extremely strong evidence that the
#average chick weight is different for the various feed types. We reject the null
#hypothesis that the mean value of chick weight is the same for all categories.

#We are specifically interested in the casein and meatmeal diet types. Do the
#reported chick weights have the same variance? To determine, conduct an F-test:
var.test(chickwts$weight[chickwts$feed == "casein"],
         chickwts$weight[chickwts$feed == "meatmeal"],
         alternative = "two.sided")

#The p-value for this test is 0.9739 meaning that, under the null hypothesis, we
#would expect to see results at least as extreme as ours about 97.39% of the time.
#Thus, our data does not support the alternative hypothesis that the variance among
#chick weights is different for the casein and meatmeal diet groups.
